The main reasons for the conclusion that no Environmental Impact Assessment is required are: (a) Construction activities are restricted to the carriageway boundary; (b) The works will not impact the special qualities for which the Loch Shiel National Scenic Area, the Loch Shiel Site of Special Scientific Interest and the Fassfern to Loch Ailort Road Cuttings Geological Conservation Review Site are designated; (c) Although the works have connectivity to the Loch Shiel Special Protection Area and the Ardgour Pinewoods Special Area of Conservation, the assessment under the 1994 Regulations concluded that the works would not result in any likely significant effects on the qualifying features of these sites; and (d) Any potential impacts of the works are expected to be temporary, short-term, and limited to the construction phase. The features of the project which are envisaged to avoid or prevent significant adverse effects on the environment are: (a) Containment measures will be in place to prevent debris or pollutants from entering the surrounding environment; (b) The works will be undertaken during daylight hours to minimise disturbance; and (c) Measures will be in place to ensure appropriate removal and disposal of waste.",4567990,"5 March 2024, 12:00",Environmental Protection

The features of the project which are envisaged to avoid or prevent significant adverse effects on the environment are: (a) Containment measures will be in place to prevent debris or pollutants from entering the surrounding environment; (b) The works will be undertaken during daylight hours to minimise disturbance; and (c) Measures will be in place to ensure appropriate removal and disposal of waste.",4567990,"5 March 2024, 12:00",Environmental Protection
